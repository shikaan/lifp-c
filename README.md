### Syntax Highlighting

`.lifp` files can be edited with tools supporting lisps. Common Lisp's syntax highlighters seem to work particularly well.

Some examples:

 - in Vim you can just add the following modline at the end of your file

```
; vim: ft=lisp
```

 - in Visual Studio Code use the [Common Lisp VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ailisp.commonlisp-vscode) extension

## Development

This project is written in C23, therefore you need [LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org) 20 or newer.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shikaan/lifp.git
cd lifp

# Start the REPL
make repl

# Run tests
make test

# Build the binaries
make
```

The binary will be created in the `build` directory.
